# üìß Email Setup Guide for Feedback System

The feedback system is configured to send emails to `eray.buykor@gmail.com` whenever users submit feedback.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create Gmail App Password

Since Gmail requires 2-Factor Authentication and doesn't allow direct password login for apps, you need to create an "App Password":

1. **Go to Google Account Settings:**
   - Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/

2. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication:**
   - Go to Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification
   - Follow the instructions to enable it (if not already enabled)

3. **Generate App Password:**
   - Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Or go to: Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification ‚Üí App passwords
   - Select app: **Mail**
   - Select device: **Other (Custom name)** ‚Üí Type "Kollabe Feedback"
   - Click **Generate**
   - Copy the 16-character password (format: `xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx`)

### 2. Create .env File

1. Copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` file and add your credentials:
   ```
   EMAIL_USER=eray.buykor@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password-here
   ```

   **IMPORTANT:** Replace `your-16-character-app-password-here` with the password you generated in step 1 (remove spaces).

### 3. Restart Server

```bash
npm start
```

## Testing

1. Open the app: http://localhost:3000
2. Click the green **"üí¨ Feedback"** button (bottom left)
3. Fill out the form:
   - Rate your experience (1-5 stars)
   - Enter your email (optional)
   - Write a message
4. Click **Send Feedback**
5. Check the console for confirmation message
6. Check `eray.buykor@gmail.com` inbox for the feedback email

## What Gets Sent

The email includes:
- ‚≠ê Rating (1-5 stars)
- üìß User's email (if provided)
- üè† Room name
- üïê Timestamp
- üí¨ Feedback message

The email is formatted nicely with HTML styling.

## Troubleshooting

### "Error sending email: Invalid login"
- Double-check your App Password in `.env`
- Make sure 2-Factor Authentication is enabled
- Regenerate the App Password if needed

### "Error sending email: Connection timeout"
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure Gmail SMTP is not blocked by firewall

### Email not received
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify the email address in `index.js:329`
- Check console logs for errors

## Security Notes

- The `.env` file is in `.gitignore` to prevent accidentally committing credentials
- Never share your App Password publicly
- The App Password only has access to Mail, not your full Google account
- You can revoke App Passwords anytime from Google Account settings
